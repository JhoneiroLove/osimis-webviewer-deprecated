# Osimis Web Viewer plugin

This project is a fork from [Orthanc WebViewer plugin](http://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=web-viewer).  It adds measure tools, multiple series view and split-pane.  You may try it [here](http://osimisviewer.osimis.io)

This repo also contains a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container definition for Orthanc and all its main FOSS plugins including the Osimis WebViewer that you can find [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/osimis/orthanc-webviewer-plugin/builds/)

## Usage

To use the docker container, follow [this procedure](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/osimis/eynLn).

## Build & development

This repo contains the plugin C++ code.  The html/js code lies in [this repo](https://bitbucket.org/osimis/osimis-webviewer).  A jenkins job publishes the html/js generated by gulp into this repository (in subtrees/WebViewer.git).
